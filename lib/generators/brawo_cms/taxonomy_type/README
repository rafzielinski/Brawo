  A new taxonomy type <%= class_name %> has been created!

  Next steps:

  1. Run the migration (if not skipped):
     $ rails db:migrate

  2. The taxonomy is automatically registered and will appear in the admin panel

  3. Use it in your application:
     <%= class_name %>.create(name: "My <%= class_name %>")
     <%= class_name %>.all
